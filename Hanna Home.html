          <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>I am a Curriculum Specialist with more than 12 years of experience working with and developing synchronous and asynchronous instruction for student and adult learners.  I am looking to utilize my experience as a teacher and leader within my district to build a career in curriculum, instruction, and professional development. After working as the lead teacher at the elementary level in several districts and as a math specialist across two elementary schools, my experience with assessing needs, building curriculum, managing growth, and training development in teams and individuals makes this move the next logical step in a career that I find motivating and am passionate about.
            <p>Throughout my years in the classroom, I've developed skills and expertise in areas that will be easily applied to a position in curriculum and instructional design. I have experience with several Learning Management Systems, including Schoology, Google Classroom, Canva, PowerSchool and Blackboard. I am able to read, use, and create websites using HTML5 and CSS, while working to build my knowledge of JavaScript. I've worked as an instructional coach and leader within my district to train, empower, support, and manage staff development.
            </p>
            <p>
            It is my goal to help others become more confident in themselves as learners, empower staff to develop conceptual and flexible understandings of skills, and help create work environments where data-driven, rigorous learning meet and support each member's daily activities.
          </p>
